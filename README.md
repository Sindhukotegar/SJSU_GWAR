Unveiling the Future of Carbon Emissions Trading: A Machine Learning and Neural Network Perspective on Regional Markets

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted carbon emission trading, causing short-term fluctuations and potentially reshaping long-term market dynamics. This has introduced uncertainty for stakeholders, requiring effective risk management strategies. Furthermore, the pandemic's influence on emission reduction policies and sustainable recovery efforts remains unclear. Current predictive models for carbon emission trading lack the sophistication to accurately forecast market behavior, hindering informed decision-making.In this project we will be focusing on how can we leverage advanced predictive models integrating machine learning and deep learning techniques and comprehensive datasets to enhance forecasting accuracy, thereby empowering market participants and policymakers with actionable insights amidst the dynamic landscape of global challenges.

This project was performed for our MS in Data Analytics course for the second semester, for the subject GWAR.

Here we chose data from 3 distinct areas and amalgamated them to reach our project goal, the codes for all the proposed models can be found here.
